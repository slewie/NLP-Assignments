        "### Language Model\n",
        "I used the DistilBERT language model from the Transformers library for context-aware spelling correction. DistilBERT is a smaller and faster version of BERT, which is a powerful transformer-based language model capable of capturing contextual information. Using a pre-trained language model like DistilBERT allows leveraging the learned language representations to make more informed decisions about spelling corrections based on the surrounding context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Spelling Correction Algorithm\n",
        "The implemented spelling correction algorithm is inspired by Norvig's approach but incorporates the language model for context-aware corrections. The core idea is to generate a list of candidate corrections for a potentially misspelled word and then score these candidates based on their conditional probabilities obtained from the language model and their edit distance from the original word.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each potentially misspelled word, the algorithm masks it in the input sentence and uses the language model to generate the top-k most probable token predictions at that position. These top-k tokens are then scored by combining their language model probabilities and their edit distances from the original word. The word with the highest combined score is chosen as the correction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scoring Function\n",
        "The scoring function used to rank the candidate corrections is a simple linear combination of the language model probability and the edit distance ratio. The language model probability captures the contextual fit of the candidate word, while the edit distance ratio measures the similarity to the original word. By combining these two factors, the algorithm can balance contextual relevance and similarity to the misspelled word.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hyperparameters\n",
        "The implementation includes a `topk` hyperparameter that determines the number of top candidate corrections to consider from the language model. A larger value of `topk` increases the diversity of candidates but may also introduce more irrelevant options. In this implementation, `topk` is set to 150, which should provide a reasonable balance between diversity and computational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Efficiency Considerations\n",
        "To improve efficiency, the implementation leverages PyTorch's GPU acceleration capabilities by running the language model on a GPU (if available). This can significantly speed up the inference process, especially for longer input sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Improvements\n",
        "While the current implementation provides a decent starting point, there are several areas for potential improvement:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Weighted Scoring**: Instead of a simple linear combination, a more sophisticated weighting scheme could be explored to better balance the language model probabilities and edit distances.\n",
        "2. **Beam Search**: Incorporating beam search or other decoding strategies could potentially improve the quality of corrections by considering multiple candidates simultaneously and allowing for better exploration of the search space.\n",
        "3. **Language-Specific Considerations**: The current implementation is focused on English text. For other languages, additional language-specific considerations (e.g., character sets, common misspellings, morphological rules) may need to be incorporated.\n",
        "4. **Vocabulary Expansion**: The current approach is limited to the vocabulary of the pre-trained language model. Techniques like character-level modeling or vocabulary expansion could help handle out-of-vocabulary words more effectively.\n",
        "5. **Contextual Edit Distance**: The current implementation uses a simple edit distance metric. Incorporating contextual information into the edit distance calculation (e.g., considering common misspelling patterns or keyboard layout) could further improve the spelling correction accuracy."
